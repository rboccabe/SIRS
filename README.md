#Simple Information Retrieval System (SIRS)

The Simple Information Retrieval System is a product of the Data Science Group at the University of Notre Dame. The focus of this project is to provide an educational search engine system that emphasizes explanation over speed and efficiency.

More information will be made available is the system is developed.

#Components

As in any production-quality search engine there are several components that are necessary to create a simple information retrieval system.

##Web Crawler

Web Crawling is a necessary part of any search engine, but is outside the scope of what SIRS explores. Nevertheless, a simple Website crawler is made available in the `edu.nd.sirs.websitesearch` package. The `CrawlerProcess` uses [Crawler4j](https://code.google.com/p/crawler4j/) to download Web pages to a local folder on disk.
